Inside the GTFS folder there is solution to question 2, in the part where we had to find all routes with one reroute, i have tried to explain the logic via comments and since
there data file for stop_times.txt was too large, i had to use Pandas to preprocess the data to bring it in a format that was usable, i then took the processed data as input in the 
C++ file and used it to calculate the answers. The code has thorough use of STL in it. Thank-You, please do ping me if the logic seems unclear.
